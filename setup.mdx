## Authetication:

### API Key Authentication:

<ul>
  <li>To generate an API key, sign up for an account on our platform and navigate to the "API Keys" section.</li>
  <li>Include the API key in the Authorization header of your HTTP requests, with the Token prefix:</li>
</ul>

```bash headers
Authorization: Token <your_api_key>
```

### Access Token Authentication:

<ul>
  <li>Most routes require an access token for authentication.</li>
  <li>To obtain an access token, you need to sign in to your account. After a successful sign-in, you will receive an access token.</li>
  <li>Include the access token in the Authorization header of your HTTP requests, with the Bearer prefix:</li>
</ul>

```bash headers
Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token>
```
## Getting Started

1- **Transcription Request:**
  - To transcribe a media file, send a POST request to the `/api/v1/hamsa/transcribe` endpoint.
  - Include the following JSON payload in the request body:
  ```json json
    {
      "url": "https://example.com/media.mp3",
      "webhookUrl": "https://example.com/webhook-url",
      "jobType": "async",
      "summary": true,
      "keywordExtraction": true,
      "speakerDZ": true,
      "translation": true,
      "model": "Hamsa",
      "article": true,
      "lng": "ar"
    }
  ```
  - You can use the provided developer tools to generate the cURL, JavaScript, Python, Go, PHP, or Java code for the transcription request.

2- **Receiving Transcription Updates:**
  - If you provide a webhook URL in the transcription request, you will receive updates about the job status at that URL.
  - You can also fetch the status of all your transcription jobs by making a GET request to the `/api/v1/jobs/all?jobId=[your job id]` endpoint.
