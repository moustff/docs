## Authentication

The Hamsa media-to-text APIs use <b>API Key token authentication</b>. The authentication scheme is used in the request <b>Headers</b> as follows:

```json
Authorization: Token <API Key Id>
```

To authenticate your requests, you'll need to include a valid API key token in the Authorization header. You can obtain an API key token by following the appropriate authentication flow, which is documented in the <a href="/auth">Authentication</a> section.

## Endpoints

The Hamsa API provides the following sections:
- Transcription (Media To Text) Route.
- Jobs List Route.
- Usage Routes With Two Formats.
- Get Current Project Route.

<Note>Those sections will be updated if something new was introduced.</Note>

Each endpoint of those sections is described in detail in the corresponding tab of this API reference documentation.

<Note>If you have any questions or issues, please don't hesitate to reach out to the Hamsa API team.</Note>
