## Authentication

The Hamsa API uses Bearer token authentication for most of its endpoints. The authentication scheme is defined in the OpenAPI specification as follows:

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```

To authenticate your requests, you'll need to include a valid Bearer token in the Authorization header. You can obtain a Bearer token by following the appropriate authentication flow, which is documented in the Authentication section.
